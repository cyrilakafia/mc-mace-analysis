# MC Maze Dataset Analysis

The MC_Maze dataset includes data from four recording sessions of a macaque performing delayed center-out reaches, with neural activity recorded from the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices. This data was provided by Krishna Shenoy, Mark Churchland, and Matt Kaufman from Stanford University, and you can learn more about the task design, data collection, and their analyses of the data in a number of papers, including [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21040842/) (Churchland et al. 2010).

## How can we gain insights into the neural activity of motor control and movement planning?

* Visualizing trial average reaches
* Investigating single-neuron response
* Decoding Hand Kinematic
* Visualizing Neural Trajectories (PCA)
* Tuning Curves
